Aries Crowd Source Engine, extensible and deployed on DevPool


The Aries Crowdsource engine will solve the business problem of properly estimating the associated time and cost of different development tasks so that project managers can better anticipate and manage their project time and cost expectations as well as development cycle.

Aries Crowdsource engine will provide higher accuracy than “rough estimates” over the short-to-mid-term and will iteratively refine the results as time goes on. We could conceivably see Aries as the data and logic foundation for the next evolutionary step being a purely machine estimation engine and it would make sense to seed its intelligence with the crowdsourced human data first.

Afterwards, we can source all of the bounty time estimate intelligence from our ecosystem of partners and projects and apply machine learning and AI automation to further enhance the experience. The first step is to build Aries as a parimutuel marketplace and deploy it. Its first deployment will be in DevPool.

Aries CrowdSource Engine integration into DevPool is comprised of the following unique components and tools:

Milestone 1 (Crowdsource pricing engine tool core logic + DevPool integration)

Estimated Duration: 1 month
FTE: 3
Costs: 10,000 USD


The deployment of a Parimutuel marketplace driving optimal pricing for future bounties to help optimize the time and cost of projects by accurately scoping associated time and cost with each task therein.
The integration of the Aries engine into DevPool and DevPool bounties.
Milestone 2 (Aries DevPool applied user experience enhancements)

Estimated Duration: 1 month
FTE: 3
Costs: 10,000 USD

Add first time contributor message by partner
The two business problems to solve are:

show a list of all of the bot commands that the new hunter can invoke.


Milestone 3 (Aries DevPool related process optimization)

Estimated Duration: 1 month
FTE: 3
Costs: 8,000 USD


1. Contributor Comment Financial Incentives

This will enable support for compensating pull request reviewers and synchronizing the calculation and permit generation once the bounty is completed.
Implement stale issues report
Every Monday the bot should generate a report for stale issues and post the report to Telegram group
Every Monday find all issues that have not been resolved for at least 7 days since their creation, generate a report from them and post to Telegram group. If there were no unresolved issues then do not post anything.
Contributor Dashboard Tooling: Multisend Permit Claims
Disable Bounties for "Parent Issues"
Help maintain pricing and process accuracy  
Compensation Multiplier Control and Warning Mechanisms
This feature is designed to limit a contributor's compensation for any bounty on the current repository due to other compensation structures (eg salary)

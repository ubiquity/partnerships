### 2. Ubiquity to create a Dapp to the Safe marketplace

**COMPANY/DAO/PROJECT NAME**

Ubiquity DAO

**COMPANY/PROJECT WEBSITE** 

https://ubq.fi/

**PLEASE TELL US IN DETAIL WHAT YOUR PROJECT DOES, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE SAFE, AND WHERE THE CORE CONTRIBUTORS CAN HELP (150 CHARACTERS MINIMUM)** 

- Ubiquity DAO is building an ecosystem bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional economies.
- We develop a stablecoin, a bounty marketplace, and plan to launch fiat cashout options including bank transfers and a crypto debit card.
- Ubiquity uses Gnosis Chain for payouts to DAO core contributors and bounty hunters.  

We offer Gnosis and Safe Ecosystem to partner in the creation of the Safest crypto card. 

It is planned that users' funds will be protected with the complete set of security features:
- Using SAFE.
- Shielding card information with temporary virtual cards (as on https://privacy.com/).
- Ability to configure card transaction multisig with on-chain and common 2FA methods (a customizable analog of 3DS).
- Ability to configure white and blacklists, as well as spending limits for transactions (by MCC, countries, specific destinations).
- Ability to protect funds by temporary card freezing in case of customizable fraud triggers.

Looking forward to your feedback and ideas.

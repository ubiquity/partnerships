The Aries Crowdsource engine will solve the business problem of properly estimating the associated time and cost of different development tasks so that project managers can better anticipate and manage their project time and cost expectations as well as development cycle.

Aries Crowdsource engine will provide higher accuracy than “rough estimates” over the short-to-mid-term and will iteratively refine the results as time goes on. We could conceivably see Aries as the data and logic foundation for the next evolutionary step being a purely machine estimation engine and it would make sense to seed its intelligence with the crowdsourced human data first.

Afterwards, we can source all of the bounty time estimate intelligence from our ecosystem of partners and projects and apply machine learning and AI automation to further enhance the experience. The first step is to build Aries as a parimutuel marketplace and deploy it. Its first deployment will be in DevPool.

Aries CrowdSource Engine integration into DevPool is comprised of the following unique components and tools:

**Milestone 1 (Crowdsource pricing engine tool core logic + DevPool integration)**

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

1. **The deployment of a Parimutuel marketplace** driving optimal pricing for future bounties to help optimize the time and cost of projects by accurately scoping associated time and cost with each task therein.
2. **The integration of the Aries engine** into DevPool and DevPool bounties.

**Milestone 2 (Aries DevPool applied user experience enhancements)**

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

1. **First Time Bounty Hunter Tutorial**
2. **Max Bounty Hunter Issues system controls**
3. **Toggle Config for Comment Incentives for Bounty Hunters**
    
    Let repo specific enable/disable config for bounty hunters to collect comment incentives.
    
    Selectively enabling support for bounty hunters to collect comment incentives (e.g. provide a daily update on that onlydust listing)
    
4. **Add first time contributor message by partner**
    
    The two business problems to solve are:
    
    - a custom message that partners can use to greet new hunters
    - show a list of all of the bot commands that the new hunter can invoke.

**Milestone 3 (Aries DevPool related process optimization)**

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD

1. **Contributor Comment Financial Incentives**

- This will enable support for compensating pull request reviewers and synchronizing the calculation and permit generation once the bounty is completed.
1. **Implement stale issues report**
    - Every Monday the bot should generate a report for stale issues and post the report to Telegram group
    - Every Monday find all issues that have not been resolved for at least 7 days since their creation, generate a report from them and post to Telegram group. If there were no unresolved issues then do not post anything.
2. **Contributor Dashboard Tooling: Multisend Permit Claims**
3. **Disable Bounties for "Parent Issues"**
    - Help maintain pricing and process accuracy
4. **Compensation Multiplier Control and Warning Mechanisms**
    - This feature is designed to limit a contributor's compensation for any bounty on the current repository due to other compensation structures (eg salary)
